This project is made to show what I've been learning about React.js.

## Calculator

This project is a basic calculator and the next tools were used to make it possible:

### Material-UI
**Version 4.4.0**

This was implemented to use some features of this tool, mainly the *Grid*, to distribute the keys and the boxes with the operations along the screen.

### Redux
**Version 4.0.4**

Used to manage the state of the application. It was also necessary to install **react-redux v7.1.1** and **redux-actions v2.6.5** (to ease the state management using some features like *createAction* and *handleActions*).

### Node Sass
**Version 4.12.0**

This was used to ease the management of styles applied to this project, and also because this is familiar to use.

### Mathjs
**Version 6.2.1**

Tool used to apply math to a String that contains operations, but that is still a String.
